# **Testcase Prioritization In Regression Testing**

In regression testing, prioritizing test cases is crucial to efficiently detect potential issues caused by changes in the software. It involves categorizing test cases based on their importance, impact, and likelihood of failure. This prioritization helps in focusing on critical functionalities, high-risk areas, or those most affected by recent modifications. Techniques like risk-based prioritization, focusing on recent changes, code coverage, historical failure rates, dependencies, time constraints, customer impact, and combining these criteria are used to determine the order in which test cases should be executed. This approach ensures that testing efforts concentrate on areas with higher probabilities of encountering problems, optimizing the testing process within resource constraints.

Objectives of this project are :-

1. **Automate Prioritization:** Implement automation for quick and accurate test case 
prioritization.
2. **Detect Defects Early:** Identify and address critical defects at the earliest stages.
3. **Minimize Testing Time:** Reduce the time required for regression testing without 
compromising coverage.
4. **Prevent Historical Defects:** Prioritize areas with a history of defects to prevent 
regression.
5. **Optimize Testing Strategy:** Balance thorough testing with the need for timely software 
releases.
6. **Optimize Resource Use:** Efficiently allocate testing resources within constraints
